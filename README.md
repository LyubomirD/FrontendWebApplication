# Frontend

Welcome to my minimalist frontend for my evolving WebApplication,
where I embrace the microservice architecture. Presently, the interface 
features streamlined Login and Sign Up web pages, but I envision a future 
where this project would become template for bigger, better projects!

While working on this side project I develop skills and expand my knowledge. 
This project does not only reflect my commitment to personal growth 
but also underscores my passion for continuous improvement.
